## Introduction

[reef-pi](http://reef-pi.com) is an opensource [reef tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_aquarium) controller based on  [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). This is the software repository for reef-pi. If you are trying to build a physical controller to automate your reef tank, use reef-pi [website](http://reef-pi.com). If you are new to reef keeping and want to know about the hobby use one of the online forums such as [reef2reef](https://www.reef2reef.com/) or [nano-reef](https://www.nano-reef.com/)(for smaller reef tanks).


reef-pi is an [award winning](https://reef-pi.github.io/blogs/makerfaire-2017/), modular, do it yourself (DIY) project that aims to provide a hackable, affordable reef tank automation platform using easy to learn electronics. Apart from Raspberry Pi, reef-pi uses a handful of additional electronics boards from [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), a open hardware, community-focused electronics company. reef-pi is under active development. Follow reef2reef [thread](http://www.reef2reef.com/threads/reef-pi-an-open-source-raspberry-pi-based-reef-tank-controller.289256/) if you want to stay up to date with reef-pi development. Use the build guides on reef-pi [website](http://reef-pi.com) if you just want to build a reef tank controller based on reef-pi. We use slack for developer communication.
